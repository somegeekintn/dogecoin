### About Moon
---

Moon is an OS X dogecoin client that sits on top of the offcial dogecoin code. Similar to the QT version of the client, in that it doesn't really do much work itself, rather it communicates with the core code which then does all the heavy lifting. Although based on dogecoin it should be easy to use with any coin based on bitcoin. 

Currently Moon is a bit of a science project. At the moment it only implements a fraction of the functionality that the QT version wallet and isn't nearly as refined. I hope to at least get it to the point that it's usable as a very basic wallet. It's purpose at this point is more to help me increase my understanding of bitcoin and bitcoin derived clients.


### Progress
---

Moon is still very early in its development cycle. At the moment it provides some technical information that isn't easily discovered in the QT version. In addition Moon can send and receive coins.

### Donations
---

I plan to continue picking at Moon until I have a fully functional wallet and my interest in crypto-currency continues. Of course if you want to send a token of encouragement or appreciation my way it would be much appreciated.
