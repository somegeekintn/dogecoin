### About Moon
---

Moon is an OS X Dogecoin client that sits on top of the offcial Dogecoin code. Similar to the QT version of the client, in that it doesn't really do much work itself, rather it communicates with the core code which then does all the heavy lifting. Although based on Dogecoin it should be easy to use it with any coin that based on Bitcoin. 

I'm writing Moon in an effort to increase my understanding of Bitcoin and its derivatives. Also I don't much care for the QT version of the wallet.


### Progress
---

Moon is still very early in its development cycle. At the moment it provides some technical information that isn't easily discovered in the QT version and also displays a read-only version of your wallet. Although Moon is in read-only mode, you should still use caution and make a backup of your wallet before running the app.

### Donations
---

I plan to continue picking at Moon until I have a fully functional wallet and my interest in crypto-currency continues. Of course if you want to send a token of encouragement or appreciation my way it would be much appreciated.
